                   The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) is a joint
                   venture company of the Government of India and the states of Haryana,
                   Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi. The NCRTC is mandated with
                   implementing the Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) project across the
                   National Capital Region (NCR), ensuring a balanced and sustainable urban
                   development through better connectivity and access. The Union Cabinet
                   approved constitution of the NCRTC under the Companies Act, 1956, in
                   July 2013 for designing, developing, implementing, financing, operating,
                   and maintaining the RRTS in the NCR to provide comfortable and fast
                   transit to NCR towns and to meet the high growth in transport
                   demand.[30][31] Accordingly, the NCRTC was incorporated on 21 August
                   2013.[32] Vinay Kumar Singh was appointed as the first regular managing
                   director of the NCRTC in July 2016

                    transport systems in Mumbai include the Mumbai Suburban Railway,
                    Monorail, Metro, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST)
                    buses, black-and-yellow meter taxis, auto rickshaws and ferries.
                    Suburban railway and BEST bus services together accounted for about 88%
                    of the passenger traffic in 2008.[250] Auto rickshaws are allowed to
                    operate only in the suburban areas of Mumbai, while taxis are allowed to
                    operate throughout Mumbai, but generally operate in South Mumbai.[251]
                    Taxis and rickshaws in Mumbai are required by law to run on compressed
                    natural gas (CNG),[252] and are a convenient, economical, and easily
                    available means of transport Road Mumbai is served by National Highway
                    48, National Highway 66, National Highway 160 and National Highway
                    61.[280] The Mumbai–Chennai and Mumbai–Delhi prongs of the Golden
                    Quadrilateral system of National Highways start from the city. The
                    Mumbai-Pune Expressway was the first expressway built in India.[281] The
                    Eastern Freeway was opened in 2013. The Mumbai Nashik Expressway,
                    Mumbai-Vadodara Expressway,[282] are under construction. The
                    Bandra-Worli Sea Link bridge, along with Mahim Causeway, links the
                    island city to the western suburbs.[283] The three major road arteries
                    of the city are the Eastern Express Highway from Sion to Thane, the Sion
                    Panvel Expressway from Sion to Panvel and the Western Express Highway
                    from Bandra to Bhayander.[284] Mumbai has approximately 1,900 km (1,181
                    mi) of roads.[285] There are five tolled entry points to the city by
                    road.[286] Mumbai had about 721,000 private vehicles as of March
                    2014,[287] 56,459 black and yellow taxis as of 2005,[288] and 106,000
                    auto rickshaws, as of May 2013.[289]

                    Public transport is provided by the Kolkata Suburban Railway, the
                    Kolkata Metro, trams, rickshaws, taxis and buses. The suburban rail
                    network connects the city's distant suburbs. The Kolkata Metro is the
                    oldest rapid transit system in India. According to a 2013 survey
                    conducted by the International Association of Public Transport, in terms
                    of a public transport system, Kolkata ranks among the top of the six
                    Indian cities surveyed.[168][169] The Kolkata Metro, in operation since
                    1984, is the oldest underground mass transit system in India.[170] It
                    spans the north–south length of the city. In 2020, part of the Second
                    line was inaugurated to cover part of Salt Lake. This east–west line
                    will connect Salt Lake with Howrah. The two lines cover a distance of
                    33.02 km (21 mi). As of 2020, four Metro rail lines were under
                    construction.

                    There are about 1,800 km (1,100 mi) of roads in Ladakh of which 800 km (500 mi) are surfaced.[96] The majority of roads in Ladakh are looked after by the Border Roads Organisation. There are two main roads that connect Ladakh with the rest of the country, NH1 connecting Srinagar to Kargil and Leh, and NH3 connecting Manali to Leh. A third road to Ladakh is the Nimmu–Padam–Darcha road, which is under construction.[97]

                    There is an airport in Leh, Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport, from which there are daily flights to Delhi and weekly flights to Srinagar and Jammu. There are two airstrips at Daulat Beg Oldie and Fukche for military transport.[98] The airport at Kargil, Kargil Airport, was intended for civilian flights but is currently used by the Indian Army. The airport is a political issue for the locals who argue that the airport should serve its original purpose, i.e., should open up for civilian flights. Since past few years the Indian Air Force has been operating AN-32 air courier service to transport the locals during the winter seasons to Jammu, Srinagar and Chandigarh.[99][100] A private aeroplane company Air Mantra landed a 17-seater aircraft at the airport, in presence of dignitaries like the Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, marking the first ever landing by a civilian airline company at Kargil Airport</P>

                    Himachal is known for its narrow-gauge railways. One is the Kalka-Shimla Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and another is the Kangra Valley Railway.[94] The total length of these two tracks is 259 kilometres (161 mi). The Kalka-Shimla Railway passes through many tunnels and Bridgies, while the Pathankot–Jogindernagar one meanders through a maze of hills and valleys. The total route length of the operational railway network in the state is 296.26 kilometres (184.09 mi).[95][96][97]

                    Roads are the major mode of transport in Himachal Pradesh due to it's hilly terrain. The state has road network of 28,208 kilometres (17,528 mi),[98] including eight National Highways (NH) that constitute 1,234 kilometres (767 mi) and 19 State Highways with a total length of 1,625 kilometres (1,010 mi).[98] Hamirpur district has the highest road density in the country.[99] Some roads are closed during winter and monsoon seasons due to snow and landslides. The state-owned Himachal Road Transport Corporation with a fleet of over 3,100,[100] operates bus services connecting important cities and towns with villages within the state and also on various interstate routes. In addition, around 5,000 private buses ply in the state.</p>

                    Kerala has 331,904 kilometres (206,236 mi) of roads, which accounts for 5.6% of India's total.[22][368] This translates to about 9.94 kilometres (6.18 mi) of road per thousand people, compared to an average of 4.87 kilometres (3.03 mi) in the country.[22][368] Roads in Kerala include 1,812 kilometres (1,126 mi) of national highway; 1.6% of the nation's total, 4,342 kilometres (2,698 mi) of state highway; 2.5% of the nation's total, 27,470 kilometres (17,070 mi) of district roads; 4.7% of the nation's total, 33,201 kilometres (20,630 mi) of urban (municipal) roads; 6.3% of the nation's total, and 158,775 kilometres (98,658 mi) of rural roads; 3.8% of the nation's total.[369] Kottayam has the maximum length of roads among the districts of Kerala, while Wayanad accounts for minimum.[370] Most of Kerala's west coast is accessible through the NH 66 (previously NH 17 and 47); and the eastern side is accessible through state highways.[371] New projects for hill and coastal highways were recently announced under KIIFB.[372] National Highway 66, with the longest stretch of road (1,622 kilometres (1,008 mi)) connects Kanyakumari to Mumbai; it enters Kerala via Talapady in Kasargod and passes through Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Guruvayur, Kochi, Alappuzha, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram before entering Tamil Nadu.[371] Palakkad district is generally referred to as the Gateway of Kerala, due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap in the Western Ghats, through which the northern (Malabar) and southern (Travancore) parts of Kerala are connected to the rest of India via road and rail. The state's largest checkpoint, Walayar, is on NH 544, in the border town between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, through which a large amount of public and commercial transportation reaches the northern and central districts of Kerala.[373]

                    The Department of Public Works is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways system and major district roads.[374] The Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP), which includes the GIS-based Road Information and Management Project (RIMS), is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways in Kerala. It also oversees a few major district roads.[375][376] Traffic in Kerala has been growing at a rate of 10–11% every year, resulting in high traffic and pressure on the roads. Traffic density is nearly four times the national average, reflecting the state's high population. Kerala's annual total of road accidents is among the nation's highest. The accidents are mainly the result of the narrow roads and irresponsible driving.[377] National Highways in Kerala are among the narrowest in the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future, as the state government has received an exemption that allows narrow national highways. In Kerala, highways are 45 metres (148 feet) wide. In other states, national highways are grade separated, 60 metres (200 feet) wide with a minimum of four lanes, as well as 6 or 8-lane access-controlled expressways.[378][379] The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has threatened the Kerala state government that it will give higher priority to other states in highway development since political commitment to better highways in Kerala has been lacking.[380] As of 2013, Kerala had the highest road accident rate in the country, with most fatal accidents taking place along the state's national highways.[381]

                    Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is a state-owned road transport corporation. It is one of the country's oldest state-run public bus transport services. Its origins can be traced back to Travancore State Road Transport Department, when the Travancore government headed by Sri. Chithra Thirunnal decided to set up a public road transportation system in 1937.
                    
                    The corporation is divided into three zones (North, Central and South), with the headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala's capital city). Daily scheduled service has increased from 1,200,000 kilometres (750,000 mi) to 1,422,546 kilometres (883,929 mi),[382] using 6,241 buses on 6,389 routes. At present the corporation has 5373 buses running on 4795 schedules.[383][384]
                    
                    The Kerala Urban Road Transport Corporation (KURTC) was formed under KSRTC in 2015 to manage affairs related to urban transportation.[370] It was inaugurated on 12 April 2015 at Thevara.[385]
