                   demand.[30][31] Accordingly, the NCRTC was incorporated on 21 August
                   2013.[32] Vinay Kumar Singh was appointed as the first regular managing

                    transport systems in Mumbai include the Mumbai Suburban Railway,
                    Monorail, Metro, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST)
                    buses, black-and-yellow meter taxis, auto rickshaws and ferries.
                    Suburban railway and BEST bus services together accounted for about 88%
                    of the passenger traffic in 2008.[250] Auto rickshaws are allowed to
                    operate only in the suburban areas of Mumbai, while taxis are allowed to
                    operate throughout Mumbai, but generally operate in South Mumbai.[251]
                    Taxis and rickshaws in Mumbai are required by law to run on compressed
                    natural gas (CNG),[252] and are a convenient, economical, and easily
                    available means of transport Road Mumbai is served by National Highway
                    48, National Highway 66, National Highway 160 and National Highway
                    61.[280] The Mumbai–Chennai and Mumbai–Delhi prongs of the Golden
                    Quadrilateral system of National Highways start from the city. The
                    Mumbai-Pune Expressway was the first expressway built in India.[281] The
                    Eastern Freeway was opened in 2013. The Mumbai Nashik Expressway,
                    Mumbai-Vadodara Expressway,[282] are under construction. The
                    Bandra-Worli Sea Link bridge, along with Mahim Causeway, links the
                    island city to the western suburbs.[283] The three major road arteries
                    of the city are the Eastern Express Highway from Sion to Thane, the Sion
                    Panvel Expressway from Sion to Panvel and the Western Express Highway
                    from Bandra to Bhayander.[284] Mumbai has approximately 1,900 km (1,181
                    mi) of roads.[285] There are five tolled entry points to the city by
                    road.[286] Mumbai had about 721,000 private vehicles as of March
                    2014,[287] 56,459 black and yellow taxis as of 2005,[288] and 106,000
                    auto rickshaws, as of May 2013.[289]

                    Public transport is provided by the Kolkata Suburban Railway, the
                    Kolkata Metro, trams, rickshaws, taxis and buses. The suburban rail
                    network connects the city's distant suburbs. The Kolkata Metro is the
                    oldest rapid transit system in India. According to a 2013 survey
                    conducted by the International Association of Public Transport, in terms
                    of a public transport system, Kolkata ranks among the top of the six
                    Indian cities surveyed.[168][169] The Kolkata Metro, in operation since
                    1984, is the oldest underground mass transit system in India.[170] It
                    spans the north–south length of the city. In 2020, part of the Second
                    line was inaugurated to cover part of Salt Lake. This east–west line
                    will connect Salt Lake with Howrah. The two lines cover a distance of
                    33.02 km (21 mi). As of 2020, four Metro rail lines were under
                    construction.

                    Pune is well-connected to rest of the country by national highways and
                    state highways. National highways passing through the city are NH 48, NH
                    65 and NH 60. State highways passing through the city are MSH 27. The
                    Mumbai Pune Expressway, India's first six-lane expressway, was built in
                    2002, and significantly reduces the distance traveled by NH 48 between
                    these cities
